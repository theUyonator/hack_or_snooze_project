# hack_or_snooze_project
This project is a play off of the Hacker News Blog site which is a popular platform where developers go to get up to date with the latest developer news. Springboard created a similar api called hack-or-snooze as the original Hacker news api needed authentication.  
The hack_or_snooze API documentation can be found here: https://hackorsnoozev3.docs.apiary.io/
